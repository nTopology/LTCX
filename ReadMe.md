#NTLatticeGraph

##About
NTLatticeGraph is a portable file specification for representing lattice structures. The main goals of NTLatticeGraph are as follows:

* A simple graph-based representation of a lattice that contains nodes, beams, & in the near future, surfaces.

##Usage
We plan to open-source a NTLatticeGraph Parser & put it here ASAP. Additionally we will include some sample files too.

Until then, please see the spec & schema.
