#NTLatticeGraph

##About
NTLatticeGraph is a lightweight, portable file specification for representing 3D lattice structures. NTLatticeGraph is, appropriately enough, a graph representation; its purpose is to allow for lattices to be designed, manipulated, simulated, and manufactured easily.

##Usage
We plan to open-source a NTLatticeGraph Parser & put it here ASAP. Additionally we will include some sample files too.

Currently the file extension is `.ltcx`, the `.ltc` is for lattice & the `x` is for xml. We plan to have an even lighter weight binary version of NTLatticeGraph too.

Until then, please see the [spec](https://github.com/nTopology/NTLatticeGraph/blob/master/Spec.md "NTLatticeGraph Spec v0.1.0")  & [schema](https://github.com/nTopology/NTLatticeGraph/blob/master/schemas/NTLG_001.xsd "NTLatticeGraph schema v0.1.0").
